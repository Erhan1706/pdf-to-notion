## Steps for execution
- Go to notion and make a connection to 'Personal'
- Change the correct page id for the notion page in script.js
- Generate new dropbox access token and change it in .env
- Don't forget to call ./run.sh with the correct path

IMPORTANT - if you had to regenerate your access token then you might need to do source .env before executing, in case the shell preloads you environment variables!!
